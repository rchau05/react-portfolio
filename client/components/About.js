            I am a junior full stack web developer looking for opportunities to refine my skills and make great things. 
            Through self-teaching and General Assembly's 12 week Web Development Immersive I am knowledgable in full stack in 
            JavaScript and Ruby. I am also skilled in command line, using Git/GitHub, prototyping, and user design.

            I am now continuously teaching myself new web development frameworks and methodologies that will allow me to create more engaging and interactive 
            web applications for my own project and others â€” a process that I plan to continue throughout my career.
